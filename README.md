## About the Project

Lenny is a free, open source, Library-in-a-Box for libraries to preserve and lend digital books.

- 📚 Designed for libraries that want control over their digital collections.
- 🔐 Built with modern authentication, DRM, and flexible storage options.
- 🌍 Easy to self-host, customize, and scale for any library size.
- 🚀 Active development and open to contributions!

---

## Features

- **Full Lending Workflow**: Borrow, return, and manage digital books.
- **API-first**: RESTful endpoints for integration and automation.
- **Containerized**: Simple Docker deployment and robust Makefile for scripts.
- **Book Importer**: Quickly load hundreds of test books for demos or pilots.
- **Readium Integration**: Secure, browser-based reading experience.
- **Flexible Storage**: S3, Internet Archive, or local file support.
- **Database-backed**: Uses PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy.

---
## OPDS 2.0 Feed
- Lenny is powered by [OPDS 2.0 Specs](https://opds.io).Lenny has its own OPDS 2.0 Package `pyopds2_lenny` more on [pyopds2_lenny](https://github.com/ArchiveLabs/pyopds2_lenny) repo.

## Getting Started

To install and run Lenny as a production application:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArchiveLabs/lenny/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sudo sh
```

---

## Development Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ArchiveLabs/lenny.git
cd lenny
make all
```

- This will generate a `.env` file with reasonable defaults (if not present).
- Navigate to `localhost:8080` (or your `$LENNY_PORT`).
- Enter the API container with:  
  `docker exec -it lenny_api bash`

---

## Importing Test Books

```sh
docker exec -it lenny_api python scripts/load_open_books.py 
```

---

## Testing Readium Server

```sh
BOOK=$(echo -n "s3://bookshelf/32941311.epub" |  base64 | tr '/+' '_-' | tr -d '=')
echo "http://localhost:15080/$BOOK/manifest.json"
curl "http://localhost:15080/$BOOK/manifest.json"
```

---

## Rebuilding

```sh
docker compose -p lenny down
docker compose -p lenny up -d --build
```
