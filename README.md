## About the Project

Lenny is a free, open source, Library-in-a-Box for libraries to preserve and lend digital books.

- 📚 Designed for libraries that want control over their digital collections.
- 🔐 Built with modern authentication, DRM, and flexible storage options.
- 🌍 Easy to self-host, customize, and scale for any library size.
- 🚀 Active development and open to contributions!

---

## 🔐 Authentication Modes

Lenny supports two authentication modes for lending:

1.  **OAuth Implicit (Default)**: Standard OPDS authentication flow. Clients like Thorium Reader use this to request a token via a popup/webview.
2.  **Direct Token**: A simpler, link-based authentication flow. Useful for environments where full OAuth support is tricky.
    *   **Browser-Friendly**: Users authenticate via an OTP (One-Time Password) email directly in the browser.
    *   **How to Enable**: This mode is **dynamic** and applies per-session.
    *   **Trigger**: Append `?auth_mode=direct` (or legacy `?beta=true` for backward compatibility) to any OPDS feed URL (e.g. `/v1/api/opds?auth_mode=direct`).
    *   **Sticky Session**: Once entered, the session remembers the mode, and all generated links (navigation, shelf, profile) will automatically keep you in that mode.

To switch back to OAuth mode, simply visit the root feed without the parameter (after clearing cookies/session if necessary).

---

## Features

- **Full Lending Workflow**: Borrow, return, and manage digital books.
- **API-first**: RESTful endpoints for integration and automation.
- **Containerized**: Simple Docker deployment and robust Makefile for scripts.
- **Book Importer**: Quickly load hundreds of test books for demos or pilots.
- **Readium Integration**: Secure, browser-based reading experience.
- **Flexible Storage**: S3, Internet Archive, or local file support.
- **Database-backed**: Uses PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy.

---
## OPDS 2.0 Feed
- Lenny is powered by [OPDS 2.0 Specs](https://opds.io).Lenny has its own OPDS 2.0 Package `pyopds2_lenny` more on [pyopds2_lenny](https://github.com/ArchiveLabs/pyopds2_lenny) repo.

---
## Technologies

- **Docker** for deployment and containerization  
- **nginx** as a reverse proxy  
- **FastAPI** (Python) as the web & API framework  
- **Minio** API for storing digital assets  
- **YAML** for configuring library-level rules  
- **PostgreSQL** for the database  
- **SQLAlchemy** as the Python ORM  
- **Readium LCP** for DRM  
- **Readium Web SDK** for a secure web reading experience  
- **OPDS** for syndicating holdings

## Endpoints

- `/v{1}/api`
- `/v{1}/manage`
- `/v{1}/read`
- `/v{1}/opds`
- `/v{1}/stats`

---

## Getting Started

To install and run Lenny as a production application:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArchiveLabs/lenny/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

---

## Development Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ArchiveLabs/lenny.git
cd lenny
make all
```

- This will generate a `.env` file with reasonable defaults (if not present).
- Navigate to `localhost:8080` (or your `$LENNY_PORT`).
- Enter the API container with:  
  `docker exec -it lenny_api bash`

---

## Adding Books encrypted or unencrypted

To add a book to Lenny, you must provide an OpenLibrary Edition ID (OLID). Books without an OLID cannot be uploaded.

### Adding Books Metadata

Sign in to your Openlibrary.org account.

```link
https://openlibrary.org/books/add
```

navigate to the above link and add all the details.

### Usage

```sh
make addbook olid=OL123456M filepath=/path/to/book.epub [encrypted=true]
```

### Examples

```sh
# Add an unencrypted book
make addbook olid=OL60638966M filepath=./books/mybook.epub

# Add an encrypted book
make addbook olid=OL60638966M filepath=./books/mybook.epub encrypted=true

# Using numeric OLID format (without OL prefix and M suffix)
make addbook olid=60638966 filepath=./books/mybook.epub
```

### Important Notes

- **File Location**: The EPUB file must be within the project directory (e.g., in `./books/` or project root)
- **OLID Formats**: Accepts both `OL123456M` and `123456` formats
- **Duplicates**: If a book with the same OLID already exists, the upload will fail with a conflict.

### Troubleshooting

If you get a "File not found" or permission error, make sure:
1. The file is copied into your lenny project directory.
2. You're using a relative path from the project root (e.g., `./books/mybook.epub`)

---

## Testing Readium Server

```sh
BOOK=$(echo -n "s3://bookshelf/32941311.epub" |  base64 | tr '/+' '_-' | tr -d '=')
echo "http://localhost:15080/$BOOK/manifest.json"
curl "http://localhost:15080/$BOOK/manifest.json"
```

---

## Rebuilding

```sh
docker compose -p lenny down
docker compose -p lenny up -d --build
```

## FAQs

<details>
<summary><b>Everything is broken and I need to start from scratch</b></summary>

```sh
make tunnel rebuild start preload items=10 log
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>If I disconnect from the internet and tunnel stops working, what do I do?</b></summary>

```sh
make untunnel tunnel start
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I am getting database connection problems</b></summary>

```sh
make resetdb restart preload items=5
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I need to stop services (also kills the tunnel)</b></summary>

```sh
make stop 
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The /v1/api/items/{id}/read endpoint redirects to Nginx default page</b></summary>

This happens when using `docker compose up -d` directly instead of `make start` or `make build`.

**Why it happens**: The Thorium Web reader requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables at build time. When running `docker compose up -d` directly, these variables may not be passed correctly.

**Solution**: Use the Makefile commands which properly source the environment:

```sh
# Fast build (uses cache)
make build

# Full rebuild (no cache)
make rebuild
```

Both commands source `reader.env` before building, ensuring the reader is configured correctly.

## Tests

All automated tests are in the `tests/` directory.

To run tests:

```sh
pytest
```

- Install dependencies:  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Test configs via `.env.test` if needed.
