Nobody can register themselves — there is no public registration endpoint, and
the RFC 8414 metadata does not advertise one. This is how a client comes to
exist, and how the operator sees who is connected and cuts one off. Without it
the only remedy would be an ORM call in a Python console.

library decides who may act on its patrons' behalf, and for this ecosystem the
consumers are a known, curated set rather than a long tail. See #209.
