"""
    Import job state for Lenny.

    Books normally appear in the catalog only once they are fully ingested
    (S3 + DB row committed) — there is no observable in-between. This module
    records the in-flight state of a book so the admin UI can show what is
    still downloading, and what failed.

    It is deliberately source-agnostic: BRIET is the first producer, but
    `preload.py` (Standard Ebooks) can adopt it without changes here.

    ponytail: state lives in the existing Cache table (7 day TTL, no status
    index) rather than a new table + migration. Move to a real `imports` table
    if these records ever need auditing or need to outlive a week.
