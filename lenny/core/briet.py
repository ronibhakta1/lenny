"""
    BRIET importer for Lenny.

    BRIET (market.briet.app) sells book bundles; a buyer receives a one-time
    redeem code. Redeeming it returns the books in that bundle — each with a
    download link and an Open Library edition key — which are then ingested
    into this Lenny instance exactly like any other book.

    The redeem endpoint is configurable via BRIET_REDEEM_URL and currently
    defaults to BRIET's DEMO marketplace (demo.market.briet.app), which speaks
    the same API with throwaway codes. Point it at the production host once
    that side is live.

    Mirrors the shape of `StandardEbooks` in scripts/preload.py: download the
    bytes, verify them, hand them to `LennyClient.upload`. Everything
    downstream (S3 keying, format detection, dedup) is already handled by
    `LennyAPI.add`.
