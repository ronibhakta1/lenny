"""
OAuth 2.0 authorization-server endpoints.

    GET  /oauth2/authorize   — authorization request (code + PKCE)
    POST /oauth2/authorize   — patron consent
    POST /oauth2/token       — code exchange and refresh
    POST /oauth2/revoke      — RFC 7009 revocation
    GET  /oauth2/loans       — protected resource, scope `loans:read`
    POST /oauth2/borrow      — protected resource, scope `borrow`

and, mounted at the site root by `lenny.app`:

    GET  /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server   — RFC 8414 metadata

Clients are registered by the operator (`make oauth2-register`), not through a
public endpoint: a library decides who may act on its patrons' behalf, and the
consumers here are a curated set rather than a long tail. RFC 7591 dynamic
registration is therefore deliberately absent, and the metadata does not
advertise a registration endpoint.

These live beside the existing `/oauth/*` OPDS routes rather than replacing
them. The OPDS implicit flow is what native OPDS readers speak today; this is
what a server-side consumer such as Open Library needs. See lenny#209.

    Delegates to `Item.borrow`, which is the only place lending policy lives:
    open-access items are not lendable, and the per-patron concurrent limit and
    the per-item copy count are both enforced. Calling `Loan.create` directly
    here would be a second, divergent copy of that policy — and silently skip
    every part of it.

    Note that this endpoint is the reason `Item.borrow` locks the patron as well
    as the item. A browser gets one click at a time; a backend consumer holding
    a token issues borrows in parallel, which is what turned a theoretical race
    on the per-patron limit into an observed bypass.
